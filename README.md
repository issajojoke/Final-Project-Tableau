# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
## Create a tableau dashboard of 5 visuals that answers a question I came up, based on the data set I chose.

## Process
### Pick a topic that interested me
### Study the data set and understand it
### Come up with a question
### Decide which visuals would help me answer my question
### Make visuals
### Make dashboard

## Results
### I chose option 2 and used the AirBnb_NYC dataset. The question I wanted to answer was "Where should guests on AirBnb stay in New York based on their group size?". I created 5 visuals that all used the NYC neighbourhoods as a filter. I started off by creating a chart that sorted the number of stays available in each neighbourhood based on number of beds, this would be an easy way to compare how many options there are and which neighbourhood can accommodate smaller or bigger groups. Then I created another graph that included the property type (entire home, shared room, private room). A map was necessary to understand where these neighbourhoods were, so I created a map that was coloured and labelled by zip code and neighbourhood. I also included another visual that took the average price of stays in each zipcode area, this was also coloured and labelled to match the map visual. Since the neighbourhood is used as the filter, it is easier to find relevant stays. My final visual was a forecast that predicted how much new listings would cost in these neighbourhoods in the case that guests would prefer to wait for cheaper stays. 

## Challenges 
### Putting everything together on the dashboard was actually quite a challenge for me. Trying to fit the visuals in a uniform and visually pleasing way was more difficult than I expected.

## Future Goals
### Polish up my knowledge of Tableau and spend more time practicing making visuals/dashboards. Tableau is a very big application that's capable of so many thing. If I had more time to learn more about Tableau and what else is possible on Tableau, my project would've been better.
